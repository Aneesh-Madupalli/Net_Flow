## NetFlow Documentation

This folder contains product and technical documentation for the NetFlow project. It is the primary place for humans and AI assistants to understand how the app works and how to extend it safely.

- **Product requirements**: See `PRD.md` for the full product requirements document (PRD) for NetFlow.
- **UI/UX plan**: See `UI_PLAN.md` for the detailed design specification of the tray icon, tooltip, and menu behavior.
- **AI development context**: See the `context/` subfolder for AI-focused summaries and guardrails that help automated assistants work on this codebase clearly and quickly.

### Structure

- `PRD.md` — Product Requirements Document for NetFlow.
- `UI_PLAN.md` — Final UI/UX design specification.
- `context/` — Short, high-signal documents optimized for AI-assisted development (architecture summary, constraints, coding guidelines, etc.).
